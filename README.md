**Problem Statement**
                Kansas City has a problem with vacant and abandoned properties.  It’s not that properties are undesirable—it’s that vacant properties often have old mortgages, liens or other claims against them that prevent them from being developed. 
The Land Bank of Kansas City has more than 2,000 vacant properties with legal claims against them.
                Neighborhood Legal Support of Kansas City is a not-for-profit law firm that clears legal claims from Land Bank properties, so the properties can be rehabbed and turned into good quality housing for families. 
Currently NLS handles litigation to clear title on Land Bank properties one house at a time.  Even if lien holder, like Deutsche Bank, has mortgages against 80 Land Bank properties there is currently no way to search the Recorder of Deeds database to determine the Land Bank properties that Deutsche Bank has mortgages against.

**Project Description & Background Info**
                This project would allow NLS to search the Jackson County Recorder of Deeds database to find all the Land Bank properties that a single claim holder—like Deutsche Bank—has claims against. 
Knowing this, would allow NLS to clear all Deutsche Bank claims against all Land Bank properties removed in a single case—rather than clearing titles for development one property at a time. 

**Stakeholders**
- NLS
- Legal Aid
- Neighborhood associations
- People who live in the urban core
- The Land Bank
- Jackson County

**Minimum Viable Solution**
                To create an API that can aggregate Jackson County property records and allow searches of subsets of the records (e.g. a list of all the Land Bank properties that Deutsche Bank has a mortgage against).

**Additional Opportunities**
Ability to look up the property with everything that may be necessary for the lawsuit and ability to populate forms for filing
Due Diligence for public on tax sale property
