Find outstanding claims on vacant property

Project Description:
We want to help expedite urban core land bank properties development to make Kansas City neighborhoods more livable.  We want to make affordable housing available to single families and increase investment in the urban core.

Stakeholders:
NLS (Neighborhood Legal Support) - Clear title non-profits (legal aid, land bank, Dentons, etc.) but also could be used by people who are interested in tax sale properties.

Problem:
We want to identify the claimants and all properties laying claim to file lawsuit against, but the process is really tedious and manual.  I have to go to multiple places to get the information I need.

MVP:
Land Bank properties to be searched against a single claimant.

Additional Opportunity:
Look up the property with everything that may be necessary for the lawsuit.  Court house sales office diligence for public.

We need the following team members:

Project Manager | Database Engineer | Interface Engineer | Design Lead | Back-end Developer | Business Analyst | QA Engineer
